-- Names can't be longer than 16 letters (Blizzard restriction)  They will be truncated to 16 if they are longer
-- If you do not include a name, category, or description, the temporary ones will be used
-- Anything between [=[  and ]=]  is treated as literal text, so you can use single or double quotes (' or ") without it messing up LUA.
