WoW
===
Inside your WoW folder, make a backup of it before you mess with anything.
Then copy the folders from this directory; "WTF" and "AddOns" into your World of Warcraft folder. (If you can't find it google "where is my wow folder")

Open up the WTF folder and open up the folder named Account
Account -> Cyberuke (Rename Cyberuke to whatever it was in your original wow folder you made a backup of.)

Follow the hierarchy and rename your server and character names accordingly, you should be familiar with this.

The archive.zip is just a zip file of everything.

the Keybinds.txt just shows the most optimal keybinds (in my opinion) And yes, I've applied set theory and all kinds of crazy ass equations into determining this
in addition to input from Neilyo, Reckful, Venruki, and Sodah; and all of SkillCapped. (WoW legends)

Osx, is well for if you have a mac. It makes your character jump randomly ever "x" random seconds to prevent you from going AFK (against TOS use at discrestion)

NeilyoUI is pretty self explanatory. (Except it is out of date since neilyo hasn't played since wrath, therefore my folders are pretty much an update to his to MOP)

The addon called DarkrisenUI is my personalized addon that I've written.

Enjoi.
